## LAMASUS_NUTS_EEAref_mapping.R
This code performs a countrywise mapping of the EEA reference grid (1km² pixel) to the LAMASUS NUTS regions.
As an input it uses the LAMASUS NUTS geometries, to be found at: https://zenodo.org/records/10990809 and the EEA reference grid with 1 square-kilometer resolution, to be found at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/3c362237-daa4-45e2-8c16-aaadfb1a003b.

### Processing
To ensure full coverage and no redundancies the method uses first allocation from grid to NUTS via centroid. In a second stage, all those not allocateable via centroid but only touching a single NUTS region are mapped to this. Finally, all pixels overlaying more than one region and not allocateable via centroid are mapped based on highest coverage fraction.
For completeness, all pixels that are added to the EEA reference grid and to dot overlay the NUTS geometry are mapped to a "NA_000" region.

## EEAref_EEAbiogeo_mapping.R
This code performs a countrywise mapping of the EEA reference grid (1km² pixel) to the EEA biogeographical regions.
As an input it uses the spatial information about the biogeographical regions of Europe, to be found at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/11db8d14-f167-4cd5-9205-95638dfd9618 and the EEA reference grid with 1 square-kilometer resolution, to be found at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/3c362237-daa4-45e2-8c16-aaadfb1a003b.

## get_1km_map.R
This code uses the files generated by the two former mentioned R files. It creates tiff files
